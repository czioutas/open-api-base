# ‚ö° Open-API-Base [![API CI](https://github.com/czioutas/open-api-base/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/czioutas/open-api-base/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This repository contains a free API written, with the aim to provide a fully fledged API system that can support your project from start to thousands of users/calls etc without the need of external services except infrastructure components such as Databases, Cache layers, Mailing systems etc.

## Why?

This API is built upon a decade plus of experience.
In addition we are real time capturing the **active** coding hours using wakatime which you can see üëâ [![wakatime](https://wakatime.com/badge/github/czioutas/open-api-base.svg)](https://wakatime.com/badge/github/czioutas/open-api-base)

_this does not include, build time, waiting for CI, googling, etc._
